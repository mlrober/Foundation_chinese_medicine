mai - vessel/channel
Joints
- The Joint capsules are spaces between joints where the QI enters/exits
- QI Movement is controlled by Liver & Triple Burner
- If QI enters too much, the joints will be painful
- If QI exits too much, the joints will be rigid and not flexible
Fat Tisues (GAO)
- Fat Tissues are referred to as adipose tissues which spread all over the body as per western medicine
- In Chinese Medicine, Fat tissues are referred as "Adipose Tissues in abdomen & breast" and include peridoneal membrane
- QI movement in tissues relies on Spleen QI
- Excessive QI enters will acumulate fat & obesity
- Excessive exit will result weight loss
Membranes (huang)
- Huang means membranes
- covers the whole body
- lies between superficial layer & the layer below that
- Function of wrapping & anchoring organs, muscles and bones, helps connecting organs among themselves
- In western, membranes are spread all over the body and are referred as only connecting tissues and sinews although not all are connecting tissues
- In chinese, sinews are sinews
- In chinese, memberanes are fascia that exist in abdomen
- Proper entering & exiting of QI ensure smotth circulation of QI
- Excessive entering/existing will result in abdominal distension
Bones
- In western, bones are structures in anatomical aspect
- In chinese, bones are anatomical structures and a deep energetic layer controlled by kidney
- Entering & exiting of QI will ensure healthy structures
- If excessive entry will result in night sweating
- If excessive exit will result in weak bones
Mind-spirit (Shen)
- Mind is a vital substance of body which is also related with spirit which includes all pshychic aspects like thinking, dreams etc.
- Ethereal soul provides the ideas, thinking, inspection, aim, inspiration to do something. Without it, mind is sterile
- Smotth entering & exit movement of QI ensures the coordination between mind (heart) & ethereal soul (liver)
Stomach & Spleen as central axis
- plays an important role in middle as they are source of QI & Blood
- They have other functions as highlighted earlier
- Smooth movement of QI ensures healthy
- Clinically
	- Ren-12 regulate the ascending-descending of @I
Liver & Lungs as outer wheel
- Liver on left ascends to head and orifices & lungs on right descends to internal organs
- Smooth movement of QI between these two ensure blood circulation
Heart & kidneys as root
- Heart houses mind & kidneys houses Essence
- Heart QI Descends to harmonize essence & kidney QI ascends to nourish Yin of heart to cool the fire
- As per cosmological order, the above relationships picturised as "ST/SP in centre, liv&lu in outer & H & Kd in above & below"
- Clinically
	- Ren-15 harmonize heart & Ren-4 kidneys
Triple Burner Transformation of QI
- Plays an important role in regulating the passages in the body to ensure smotth movement of QI of ascending/descending/entering/exiting of QI
- Upper burner helps lung qi to diffuse defensive QI 7fluids
- Middle burner helps smooth digestion of food
- lower burner helps transformation, transportation & excretion of fluids & waste
- Clinically
	- TW-6 to clear stagnation of QI in any part of the body especially upper burner
	- Ren-17 Upper Burner
	- Ren-12 Middle Burner
	- Ren-5 Lower Burner
Pathology of QI transformation
- Stomach & Spleen
	- Spleen QI ascends the essences from food to heart & lungs
	- If spleen QI descends, it leads to diarhea, chronic state leads to deficiency in turn becomes "Sinking QI" and causes prolabpse of organs like kidney, intestines, bladder, vagina, rectal veins due heamorages
	- If stomach QI ascends, it leads to nausea, vomiting, hickup, bulging
	- If spleen QI descends & Stomach QI ascends, it is rebellous QI
	- In chronic rebellous QI, leads to deficiency and later becomes excess in nature
	- Clinically, Du-20 will lift the Spleen QI upwards
- Liver & Lungs
	- Lung Qi fails to descend will cause congestion in chest with cough
	- Liver QI fails to descend will cause Liver Heat which raises liver Yang
	- Liver QI rebellous -> lung QI ascends -> causes headaches, red eyes, cough
	- Liver QI Stagnation -> Lung QI can't descend -> oppression of chest, depression, sadness
	- Liver QI not descending -> Liver Heat -> cough, red eyes, red sides tongue
	- Clinical -> Lu7, Lu5, Liv2
	- Liver QI not descending -> Liver QI escapes up -> cough, asthma, headaches
	- Clinical -> Lu7, Liv3, Ren-17
- Heart & Kidneys
	- Heart QI descends to meet ascending kidney QI
	- If Heart QI can't descend, kidney Yin becomes excess will acumulate fluids
	- If Heart QI can't descend, heart heat develops and causes lung QI fails to descend will result in cough and congestion in chest
	- If kidney QI can't ascend, it will lead to kidney yin deficient and lacks nourishment of liver from kidney yin

## Chapter 6 - Functions of Heart
- Heart Governs Blood
	- Ensures smooth circulation of blood all over the body
	- Person is constitutionally strong & strength
	- If impaired, person constitutionally weak and lacks strength
	- Clinical Note
		- This indicates on tongue with a long crack midline
		- Weak Pusle in both heart & kidneys
		- Person hands will become cold due to lack of blood supply
	- Heart-blood makes the menstruation occur by descending QI to uterus
	- Controls the discharge of blood occur in menstruation
	- Tonify Heart Blood
		- Ren-15, Bl-15, HE-7 with moxa cones or calm the shen in three treasures
- Controls Blood Vessels
	- Health of blood vessels reflects the state of heart blood
	- If Heart blood is full, the pulse is full and blood vessels are healthy
	- If heart QI is 
		- strong, blood vessels are healthy and pulse is strong
		- weak, blood vessels will be imparired and pulse is feeble and shinky
		- Stasis, pulse is hard and cause arterioscloresis
	- Is one of the energetic layer of body like skin, muscles, sinews, bones, blood vessels
	- Energetic layers state can be found in pulse diagnosis as:
		- Superficial layer -> skin & muscles
		- Middle Layer -> sinews & blood vessels
		- Deep Layer -> bones
- Heart manifest Complexion
	- Heart blood is healthy and it flows along the blood vessels and keeps the complexion bright
	- If there is obstruction, it reflects as:
		- Heart Blood Deficiency - Dull Pale
		- Heart Yang Deficiency - Bright White
		- Purplish or dark - Heart Blood stasis
		- Too Red - Heart heat
	- If heart is strong & blood is abundant, face is rosy lustrous
	- Red Cheeks reflect lung or liver heat
- Heart Houses Mind
	- In chines, shen is referred in 2 senses : shen as mind & Spirti
	- As "Mind" (Shen) houses the heart, it includes all mental faculties of human being
	- Also, shen includes all the mental & spiritual phenomena like all yin organs as ethereal soul, corporeal soul, inteelect, will power & shen itself
- Mind of the heart
	- Controls mental activities of human being which includes emotions as well
	- Major FUnctions are:
		- Mental Activity (emotion)
		- Consciousness
		- Memory
		- Thinking
		- Sleep
	- If heart is strong & blood is abundant, the person will be mental active with balanced emotions, good sleep and clear consciousness
	- If it is deficient, faces sleeplessness, emotionally weak, poor memory and other
	- Controls the mental activites of Mind and is responsible for insight & cognition its one of the reason for "Emperor" of all organs and which is why it is root of life and origin of mental life
	- Mind depends on the nourishment of heart blood and its function of governing blood depends on Mind. Hence, they are mutually dependent on each other
	- In Practice,
		- Heart-blood roots the mind, embraces it and anchors it
	- If heart blood is deficient, it lead to mental restlessness, depression, anxiety and insomnia
	- If person has mental restlessness, emotional problems and sadness can induce a deficiency
	- If person emotional state depends on heart blood and may impair heart if person has emotional problems.
	- If Person heart is strong, person is positive and stable state conversely, if person is positive it will also improve heart.
	- Clinically:
		- HE-7, Ren-15 best for improving heart blood when person has emotional problems
- Five Spiritual Aspects
	- Mind  (Shen):  resides  in  the  Heart,  responsible  for 
	consciousness,  thinking,  affections,  memory,  sleep 
	- Ethereal Soul  (Hun ):  resides  in  the  Liver,  responsible  for 
	sleep,  plans,  projects,  life  aims,  ‘coming  and  going  of  Shen ’ 
	- Corporeal Soul  (Po):  resides  in  the  Lungs,  responsible  for 
	physiological  activities,  sensations,  sight,  hearing,  smell, 
	taste,  ‘entering  and  exiting  of  Jing’ 
	- Intellect  (Yi ):  resides  in  the  Spleen,  responsible  for  thinking, 
	memory,  concentration 
	- Will-power  (Zhi):  resides  in  the  Kidneys,  responsible  for 
	will-power,  drive,  determin
- Heart is related to "Joy"
	- Beneficial mental state which favours a smooth functioning of the internal organs and their mental faculties.
	- Joy makes the Mind peaceful and relaxed
	- benefits the Nutritive and Defensive Qi and Makes the QI relax and slow down
	- Joy’ as a cause of disease
	 	- Excessive excitement and craving can injure the Heart.
	 	- Excess Joy (Overstimulation of heart)
	 		- Happens to people who live in a state of continuous mental stimulation through pleasure)
			- a cause of disease in patients
				- E.g. overstimulation from drugs, some medicinal drugs, advertising, consumerism, alcohol, etc.
		- Akin to inordinate craving
			-  Minister Fire flows upwards and overstimulates the Mind.
		- Joy makes the Heart larger leads to excessive stimulation of the Heart which may lead to Heart related symptoms and signs
		- The main manifestations would be palpitations, overexcitability, insomnia, restlessness, talking a lot and a red tip of the tongue.
		- If sudden may cause disease
			- E.g On hearing good news unexpectedly. ‘joy’ is akin to shock.
		- Joy injures the Heart by causing Yang Qi to float and the blood vessels to become too open and dilates and slows down and the pulse becomes Slow and slightly Overflowing but Empty. 
		-  E.g. a sudden laughter triggering a heart attack
- Heart opens to tongue
	- controls the sense of taste.
	- If Heart is normal, 
		- the tongue will have a normal pale-red colour
		- the sense of taste will be normal.
	- If the Heart has Heat,
		- the tongue may be dry and dark red
		- the tip may be redder and swollen and there may be a bitter taste.
		- If the Heat is severe,
			- the tongue may have ulcers that are red and painful.
		- If the Heart is weak and the Blood deficient
			- the tongue may be pale and thin.
	- the Heart also affects speech and abnormalities may cause stuttering or aphasia.
	- the Heart also influences talking and laughing.
		- A disharmony of excess or deficiency can cause a person to talk incessantly or laugh inappropriately.
- Heart Controls Sweat
	- - Sweat is one of  the Body Fluids that come from the space between skin and muscles. 
	- When Blood is too thick, Body Fluids enter the blood vessels 
	and thin it down.
	- Body fluids enter the blood vessels and change into Blood.
	- Since heart governs blood, the blood and body fluids mutually interchange, hence sweat is related to heart.
	- A deficiency of Heart-Qi or Heart-Yang may often cause spontaneous sweating and tonify Heart-Yang
	- A deficiency of  Heart-Yin may often cause night sweating and tonify Heart-Yin.
	- Excessive sweating happens in hot weather or hot living conditions, may injure Heart-Yang.
	- Because of the relationship of interchange between 
	Body Fluids and Blood,
		- a patient who is haemorrhaging should not be subjected to sweating
		- a patient who is sweating profusely should not have drying herbs, nor should a bleeding technique in acupuncture be used.
		- Big bleeding, do not cause sweat
		- big sweat, do not cause bleeding
		- any profuse and continuous sweating in a patient with Heart deficiency should be treated without delay, as a loss of sweat implies loss of Body Fluids, which, in turn, will lead to a deficiency of Blood because of the interchange between Blood and Body Fluids.
		- Note: Excessive sweating may also be due to organs other than the Heart. In particular, deficiency of Lung-Qi may cause spontaneous sweating. Excess sweating may also be caused by Heat or Damp-Heat, especially of the Stomach.
	- Case History
		- Excessive sweating and worsen when in stress and has insomia too
			- Treating heart will reduce sweating
	- Pathology
		- Burnt toast smell reflects heart disharmony and Heart-Fire
		- Red complexion will reflect heart disharmony but it can be caused by other organs heart too
		- It tastes bitter due to frustration, guilty, jealousy etc due to emotions as well
		- If heart disharmony, it tastes bitter only in the morning after bad night sleep
			- it is related to heart-fire
		- If liver disharmony, it tastes bitter whole day
		- Hot weather climate can harm heart as not directly but affects pericardium which leads to fever.
		- If a person laughs often for no reason may have heart disharmony
		- If a jovial person who laughs often will suffer from heart fire
		- Dreams
			- Mind should reside in heart and fell sleep easily
			- If heart is strong, person will fall sleep and have good sleep
			- If heart is weak, mind has no residence will float and have disturbed sleep and excesive dreams
			- Dreams will reflect direct state of heart
				- If heart excess, dreams related to laughing
				- If heart is deficient, dreams related to mountains, fire, smoke
		- Heart loathes heat
			- external heat can't affect heart but pericardium with cloudy which affect heart orifices and also mind
		- Heart controls speech
			- If heart fire is excess, person talks a lot or sometimes due to heart QI deficiency too

## Function of Liver
- Stores Blood
	- Storing of blood has 3 aspects
		- Regulates blood volume in relation to rest & activity
		- Regulates menstruation
		- Moisten eyes & sinews
	- Regulates blood volume in body
		- Regulates the volume of body according to physical activity
		- Person is active, blood goes to muscles & sinews and nourish them
		- Person lies down, blood goes back to liver and replenishes to rejunevate the energy
		- If person does excercise, the blood will go to the muscles & sinews associated and norish it and nourishment happens with blood
		- If no physical activity, there won't be blood flow and no nourishment happens
		- Liver blood is abundant, it will make person resist to exterior pathogenic factors
		- Clinical
			- Tonify Liver-Blood
				- ST36, Liv8, SP6
	- Regulates Menstruation
		- Liv. Blood is normal, menstruation is normal
		- Liv. Blood is deficient, scanty periods and annorhea
		- Liv. Blood is stasis, painful periods with dark clotty blood
		- Liv. Blood is hot, heavy periods with heavy blood loss
		- If disharmony in liver, will affect the penetrating & directing vessels which affect the menstruation
		- Clinical
			- Tonify St36, Liv8, Sp6, Ren-4
			- Liv3 very important as it regulates penetration vessel
	- Moistens Eyes & Sinews
		- Liver Blood moistens and nourish eyes
			- If liv blood is normal, brightens and moistens the eyes
			- If liv blood is deficient, vision is blurred and dry eyes
			- If liv blood has heat, eyes will be red and painful
		- Liver Blood moistens sinews
			- If liver blood is deficient, there will be muscle cramps and contraction of tendons
			- If liv. blood is normal, moistens the muscles & sinews
		- If Liv blood is abnormal (deficient or hot), may affect liver function
		- If liver function is abnormal, it affect the quality of blood, it gives raise to certain skin diseases like exzema or soriyasis
	- Ensures Smooth Flow of Blood
		- Has nature of exapnsive QI which ensures the functions of QI to be smotther in the body like upward, downward, entry exit or loosen etc. 
		- Supports Triple Burner on each layer as in middle burner helps spleen QI to ascend & stomach to descend and helps intestines to descend QI in lower burner.
		- Smooth flow of QI is most important aspect and usually liver QI partially flows upwards & outwards
		- 3 Aspects of Smooth flow of QI
			- Emotional State
				- As ethereal soul houses in liver, it affects or relation to emotional state or pschychic health
				- If person is in anger, QI rises upwards and congests in chest
				- It may also affect women like breast distenction, pre menstruation, abdominal distention and other emotional factors
				- Clinical
					- Liv3
			- Digestion
				- Smooth flow of QI assists the functions of stomach to rot & ripe the food and spleen to transform & transport the food QI
				- If Liver QI congests or horizontally rebellous, will stomach QI to ascend and spleen to descend which leads to various problems in body
				- It leads liver overacting on spleen condition
				- Clinical
					- Liv 13 for stomach & Liv 14 for spleen along with Ren-12
			- Secretion of Bile
				- Liver QI stagnates may lead improper secretion of bile and causes inability to digest fats, jaundice or belching or bitter taste
				- Clinical
					- Proper Secretion of Bile
						- Liv14 & GB-34
		- Controls the Sinews
			- State of sinews (includes tendosn, cartilage, ligaments) affects our movement & physical activity
			- Capacity for Contraction & relaxation of sinews are depends on nourishment & moistening from liver blood.
			- QI of food goes to stomach, extracted and refined essence from spleen flows to liver and excess QI will overflow to sinews and hence it is called extension of liver
			- Liver-Blood normal
				- supple sinews and tendons,free movement by noursihment & moistening
				- Deficiency of Liver-Blood
					- Lacks noursihment & moistening leads to cramps, numbness, tingling, spasms and if wind includes leads to tremers
				- Liver-Blood stasis
					- stiffness of sinews, rigidity, pain because of decline of QI in sinews
				- Muscle Weakness related to spleen while conditions related to extension, reflection, spasms or cramps are related to liver conditions
				- Clinical
					- Gb34 is gathering of sinews
		- Manifestes in Nails
			- Nails are by product of sinews
			- Under influence of Liver-Blood
			- As Liver Blood controls sinews and its flourishing manifests in nails
			- As ethereal soul resides in liver and manifests in nails and controls the sinews
			- If Liv blood is abundant, the nails are healthy
			- If liv blood is deficient, the nails are ridged, dry, brittle or cracked
			- If liv blood stasis, appears in dark or purple
		- Liver opens to Eyes
			- - The nourishment and moistening of Liver-Blood that gives the eyes the capacity to see.
			- If Liver-Blood is abundant, the eyes will be normally moist and the vision will be good.
			- If Liver-Blood is deficient, there may be blurred vision, myopia, ‘floaters’ in eyes, colour blindness or the eyes may feel dry and gritty.
			- Liver-Qi extends to the eyes, when the Liver is healthy the eyes can distinguish the five colours
			- The Liver corresponds to the green colour, and it opens into the 
			eye
			- If the Liver has Heat, the eyes may be bloodshot and feel painful or burning.
			- If the Liver has internal Wind, the eyeball may turn upwards and move involuntarily (nystagmus).
			- These organs affect the eyes 
				- Heart, Kidneys, Lungs, Gall Bladder, Bladder and Small Intestine. 
			- The Essence from the 5 Yin and 6 Yang organs flows upwards to irrigate the eyes.
			- In particular, the Essence of the Kidneys nourishes the eyes, so that many chronic eye diseases are related to the decline of Kidney-Essence.
			- The Heart concentrates the Essence of the 5 Yin organs and this manifests in the eye. Hence, the Heart is also closely  related  to  the  eye. As eyes mirror the state of the Heart, which houses the Mind.
			- Thus the eyes also reflect the state of the Mind and 
			the Heart.
			- Finally, the heart and kidneys are other 2 organs that affects eyes apart from liver
			- Heart-Fire can cause pain and redness of the eye and Kidney-Yin deficiency can cause failing eyesight and dryness of the eyes.
			- Summary of conditions for eye
				- Liver-Blood normal: good vision
				- Liver-Blood deficiency: blurred  vision, floaters
				- Liver-Yin  deficiency: dry, gritty eyes
				-  Liver-Blood stasis: painful eyeball
				- Liver-Yang rising: watery eyes
				- Liver-Fire: dry, bloodshot eyes (may  also  be  red,  swollen  and painful)
				- Liver-Wind: eyeball moving
		- Controls the tears
			- This fluid related to liver and have 2 types
			- Basal tears
				- which lubricates eyes
			- Reflex tears
				- that comes when a foreign body enters eye
			- Liver Yin/Blood Deficiency, leads dryness of eyes
			- Liver Yang Rising may lead to watery eyes
		- Houses Ethereal Soul
			- - The Ethereal Soul is called Hun in Chinese and is the mental–spiritual aspect of the Liver.
			- Is related to ‘spirits’ and ‘demons’.
			- Hun contains 
				- the radical Gui (spirit)
				- the radical Yun for ‘cloud’
			- Radical Gui & Yun conveys the idea of the nature of the Ethereal Soul
			- it is like a ‘spirit’ but it is Yang and ethereal in nature and 
			essentially harmless and not evil part
			- The Ethereal Soul is Yang in nature (as opposed to the Corporeal Soul) and at death survives the body to flow back to a world of subtle, non-material energies.
			- The Ethereal Soul is said to influence the capacity of planning our life and finding a sense of direction in life.
			- A lack of direction in life and mental confusion could be compared to the wandering of the Ethereal Soul alone in space and time. 
			- If the Liver-Blood is flourishing, the Ethereal Soul is firmly ted and can help us to plan our life with wisdom and vision. 
			- If Liver-Blood is weak, the Ethereal Soul is not rooted and cannot give us a sense of direction in life. 
			- If Liver-Blood or Liver-Yin is very weak, at times the Ethereal Soul may even leave the body temporarily at night during sleep or just before going to sleep. Those who suffer from severe deficiency of Yin may experience a sensation as if they were floating in the few moments just before falling asleep: this is said to be due to the ‘floating’ of the Ethereal Soul not rooted in Blood and Yin.
			- In my experience, the Ethereal Soul is also the source of life dreams, vision, aims, projects, inspiration, creativity, ideas
			- the Ethereal Soul is described as the ‘coming and going of the Mind (Shen)
			- This means that it gives the Mind the necessary other dimension of life: that is, dreams, vision, aims, projects, inspiration, creativity and ideas. Without these, the Mind would be sterile and the person would suffer from depression. On the other hand, the Mind needs to somewhat restrain the ‘coming and going’ of the Ethereal Soul to keep it under check; it also needs to integrate all the ideas spurting forth from the Ethereal Soul into our psyche in an orderly fashion. The Ethereal Soul is like an ‘ocean’ of ideas, dreams, projects and inspiration, and the Mind can only cope with one at a time. If the Ethereal Soul brings forth too much material from its 
			‘ocean’ without enough control and integration by the Mind, the person’s behaviour would become somewhat chaotic and, in extreme cases, positively manic.
			- If Liver-Blood is deficient Fire agitates the Ethereal Soul resulting 
			in nocturnal emissions with dreams. This confirms that the Ethereal Soul can become unrooted at night when Blood or Yin are deficient. 
			- Ethereal & Corporeal Soul are two poles of the same phenomenon.
			- The Corporeal Soul represents a very physical aspect of the Soul, the part of the Soul which is indissolubly linked to the body. At death, it goes back to the Earth.
		- Anger Affects Liver
			- Emotion of liver
			- Causes stagnation of Liver-Qi, especially when it is repressed
			- Vented anger often causes Liver-Yang rising or Liver-Fire.
			- a state of anger causes a Liver pathology and a Liver pathology may cause the person to become irritable
		- Liver Smell is Rancid
			- - It emanates particulary from the axillae
			- Indicates Liver-Fire or Damp-Heat in liver
		- Color is Green
			- Liver-Qi stagnation may cause a greenish complexion
			- The left cheek in particular reflects the state of the Liver. 
			- a greenish vaginal discharge indicates Dampness in the Liver channel
		- Taste is Sour
			- If a person experiences a sour taste, it will be characterized as Heat. 
			- The excessive consumption of foods or herbs with a sour taste (e.g. grapefruit) may injure the Liver, the Spleen and the muscles.
			- On the other hand, the sour taste is beneficial to the Lungs (e.g. the herb Wu Wei Zi Fructus Schizandrae, which is a Lung tonic). 
			- Though the sour taste is Liver, it should be noted that a bitter taste is very common in Liver-Fire and Damp-Heat in the Liver and Gall Bladder.
		- Climate is Wind
			- - Wind is the climate related to the Liver
			- Patient with liver disharmony may often badly affected by wind
			- E.g. 
				- causing a migraine
				- Adversely affected by a east wind (East is direction of liver)
			- Sound is Shouting
				- If person is in anger will speak louder or shout loud
			- Dreams
				- If liver excess, one dreams of being angry.
				- If Liver is deficient
				    - one dreams of very fragrant mushrooms.
				    - If the dream takes place in Spring, one dreams of lying under a tree without being able to get up.
				    - one dreams of forests in the mountains.
			- Liver is resolute Organ
				- - As in disease Liver-Qi easily becomes stagnant and excessive and Liver Yang easily flares upwards causing irritability and anger.
				- The Energy deriving from the Liver can give a person great creative drive and resoluteness.
				- Healthy Liver Function can confer a person resoluteness, an indomitable spirit and courage.
				- Mental health and character of person depends on Liver-Qi and Gall Bladder-QI
				- Manifestation  of  Liver-Qi  deficiency is on a character level that is timidity, lack of courage and indecision
			- Liver Controls Planning
				- The Liver is said to impart to us the capacity to plan our life smoothly and wisely.
				- In disease
					- a Liver disharmony can manifest with an inability to plan our life and a lack of direction.
					- This is a function of the Ethereal Soul
			- Liver is Regulating, balancing and Harmonizing Organ
				- The Liver is the root of stopping extremes.
				- The Liver has a regulating, balancing function, 
					- it houses the Ethereal Soul
					- manifests in the nails.
				- If Liver Blood is abundant, recover energy on rest
				- If Liver Blood is deficient, difficult to recover energy by resting
				- As the smooth flow of blood will ensure the smooth flow of its Qi regulates all movements of Qi in every part of the body. 
				- Emotional Impact
					- the Ethereal Soul is responsible for a balanced emotional life
			- Liver Loathes Wind
				- Windy weather often affects the Liver.
				- Liver disharmony leads to headaches and stiffness of the neck appearing after a period of windy weather
			- Liver can cause convulsion
				- Convulsion occurs as muscle relax and uncontrolled shaking of the body
				- Convulsions are a manifestation of  interior Wind
				- convulsions are due to the ‘shaking’ of the tendons, which are an extension of the Liver.
			- Liver arises from Left Side
				- Though liver Anatomically situated on the right side, energetically the Liver is on the left (and the Lungs on the right).
				- The Liver is related to the left side of the body in various ways.
				- Headaches on the left side of the head due deficiency of Liver-Blood
				- Headeaches on the right are related to the Gall Bladder.
				- ** Of course, this is not always so in practice **
				- The left side of the tongue reflects more the state of the Liver, while the right side reflects the state of the Gall Bladder.

## Functions of the Lungs
- The Lungs govern Qi and respiration
	- Lungs extract clean QI from air and combines with food-QI from spleen to form gathering QI
	- Two Aspects of its work
		- the Lungs govern respiration as
			- We inhale ‘pure Qi’ (air) and exhale ‘dirty Qi’.
			- The constant exchange and renewal of Qi performed by the Lungs ensures the proper functioning of all the body’s physiological processes that take Qi as their basis.
			- Heavenly QI refers to "Air" or "Pure QI"
		- The Lungs govern Qi as in formation of Qi.
			- Food-Qi is extracted from food by the Spleen. This is directed to the Lungs where it combines with the inhaled air to form Gathering Qi (Zong Qi).
			- As this process takes place in the chest, the chest is also called ‘Sea of Qi’ or ‘Upper Sea of Qi’ (as opposed to the Lower Sea of Qi below the navel).
			- The Gathering Qi is sometimes also called ‘Big Qi of the chest’.
			- After its formation, the Lungs spread Qi all over the body to nourish all tissues and promote all physiological processes.
			- Big Qi gathers together without moving to accumulate in the chest; it is called the Sea of Qi which comes out of the Lungs, goes to the throat and facilitates inhalation and exhalation.
			- Gathering Qi (or Big Qi) resides in the chest and aids the Lung and Heart functions, promoting good circulation to the limbs and controlling the strength of voice.
			- Weak Lung-Qi can therefore cause tiredness, a weak voice and slight breathlessness.
			- Because of their role in extracting Qi from air, and because they control the skin, the Lungs are the most ‘external’ of the Yin organs; they are the connection between the body and the outside world.
			- For this reason, the Lungs are easily attacked by exterior pathogenic factors and are sometimes referred to as the ‘delicate’ organ: that is, delicate and vulnerable to invasion by climatic factors.
		- Clinical Note
			- Gathering QI can be tonified by Ren-17
- The Lungs control channels and blood vessels
	- As the Lungs govern Qi and Qi is essential to aid the Heart to circulate Blood.
    - For this reason, although the Heart controls the blood vessels, the 
    Lungs also play an important part in maintaining the health of blood vessels.
    - In this respect, their scope is somewhat wider than that of  the Heart, since the Lungs not only control circulation in the blood vessels 
    themselves but also in all channels.
    - Nutritive Qi is closely related to Blood and the two flow together both in blood vessels and channels.
    - Since the Lungs govern Qi, they control the circulation of Qi in both blood vessels and channels.
    - As per ‘Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine’ the word  mai (‘vessel’) refers to channels while in others refers to blood vessels.
    - Summary
        - As  they  govern  Qi,  the  Lungs  control  all  (acupuncture) channels
        - As  Qi  is  the  commander  of  Blood  and  as  Nutritive  Qi (Ying Qi)  flows  in  close  contact  with  Blood,  the  Lungs  also influence  all  blood  vessels.
    - If Lung-Qi is strong, the circulation of Qi and Blood will be good and the limbs will be warm.
    - If Lung Qi is weak, Qi will not be able to push the Blood, and the 
    limbs, particularly the hands, will be cold.
- The Lungs control diffusing and descending of Qi
	- The diffusing of Qi and fluids 
		- The Lungs have the function of diffusing or spreading Defensive Qi and Body Fluids all over the body to the space between skin and muscles
		- This is one way Lungs are physiologically related to the skin.
		- The diffusing of Qi ensures that Defensive Qi is equally distributed all over the body under the skin, performing its function of  warming the skin and muscles and protecting the body from exterior pathogenic factors.
		- If  Lung-Qi is weak and its diffusing function is impaired, Defensive Qi will not reach the skin and the body will be easily invaded by exterior pathogenic factors.
		- E.g. If a person has catch a cold, the exterior wind-cold obstructs the skin which impairs the lungs diffusing function of QI. Hence, QI can't flow to skin and it will be blockage everywhere like headache, sneeing and cold etc.
		- Lungs diffuses body fluids in the form of fine 'mist' and hence upper burner is called as "mist"
		- The fine mist of Body Fluids moistens the skin and regulates the opening and closing of pores and sweating. 
		- When this function is normal, the pores open and close normally, and there is a normal, physiological, amount of sweating: 
			- the space between skin and muscles is said to be well regulated. 
		- When this function is impaired, 
			- the condition is Excess, the pores become blocked and there is no sweating: 
				- the space between the skin and muscles is said to be too ‘tight’
			- If the condition is Deficiency, the pores are over-relaxed and remain open so that there is spontaneous sweating:
				- the space between the skin and muscles is said to be too ‘loose’.
		- If  the Lung’s function of  diffusing body fluids is impaired, fluids  may  accumulate  under  the  skin, causing oedema (usually of the face).
		- Clinical Note
			- The  diffusing  of  Lung-Qi  can  be  stimulated  by  LU-7  Lieque 
	- Descending of Ling-QI
		- As lungs is uppermost organ of the body and its QI must descend, it is called as "magnificient lid" in chinese.
		- As Lung-Qi must descend to communicate with the Kidneys and these respond by ‘holding’ Qi
		- If  this descending movement of  Qi is impaired, Lung-Qi does not flow down and Qi will accumulate in the chest, causing cough, breathlessness and a feeling of oppression of the chest.
		- In some cases, it may affect the function of the Large Intestine. If the Largntestine does not receive Qi from the Lungs, it will not have the power necessary for defecation (this happens particularly in the elderly).
		- In certain cases, the impairment of the descending of Lung-Qi may also cause retention of urine (again, particularly in old people).
		- The descending function applies not only to Qi but also to Body Fluids, because the Lungs also direct fluids down to the Kidneys and Bladder. 
			- The Lungs direct fluids down to the Kidneys where Kidney-Yang evaporates them and sends them back up to the Lungs: these fluids are essential to keep the Lungs moist. 
		- The Lungs also send some fluids down to the Bladder where they are excreted as urine. 
			- For  this  reason  the  Lungs  influence urination  and  Lung-Qi  deficiency  may  cause  urinary problems
		- Clinical Note
			- The  descending  of  Lung-Qi  can  be  stimulated  by  LU-7  Lieque
	- The Lungs regulate all physiological activities
		- Lungs is compared to Prime Minister as regulates all the activities (like qi regulates activities in body).
		- Heart is an Emperror as in charge of spirit (like blood provides spirit for nourishment)
		- As QI is commander of blood (moves blood) and blood is mother of QI, this expresses the relationship between lungs & heart like QI & Blood.
		- Gathering QI is acumulated in the chest and plays an important role in assisting the heart functions. 
		- Gathering QI plays an importatn role in circulation of blood which is governed by heart.
		- Gathering QI assists the lungs & heart to propels the QI and blood to the limbs especialy hands
		- Gathering QI rises to the throat and enters the heart channel to aid breathing
		- With Prime Minister as example, lungs regulates the physiological activites of each and every organ in the body and it does in variousways as:
			- By  governing  Qi 
			- By  controlling  all  channels  and  blood  vessels 
			- By  governing  breathing
		- As Qi is the basis for all physiological activities, the Lungs, by governing Qi, are naturally in charge of all physiological activities.
		- This regulation function is dependent also on the Lungs’ action in moving Qi around the body.
		- As the Lungs are the uppermost organ in the body, their Qi naturally descends.
		- Lungs  regulate  the  ascending-descending of Qi through their descending function and the entering–exiting of Qi through their diffusing function.
		- In turn, the circulation of Qi by the Lungs depends on the Lungs controlling all channels and blood vessels. 
		- Clinical Note
			- In  Chinese  pulse  diagnosis,  we  feel  the  pulse  on  the  radial artery,  a  blood  vessel.  However,  it  is  not  by  chance  that  we  feel the  radial  artery  where  the  Lung  channel  flows.  By  feeling  the radial  artery,  and  due  to  its  connection  with  the  Lung  channel, we  also  get  a  feel  of  Qi  circulation  as  the  Lungs  govern  QI
		- As the Lungs govern breathing, this is another way in which they regulate all physiological activities. 
		- Through breathing, the Lungs distribute Qi to all tissues in every part of the body and every organ and this naturally plays an important regulating function
- The Lungs Regulate Water Passages
	- Lungs reduce the refined fluids from spleen to a fine-mist and then spray it on the space between skin and muscles. It is part of diffusing function of lungs.
	- Lungs direct the fluids down to the kidneys and which vapourize part of fluids and send back in form of "mist" to lungs to keep them moist.
	- Lungs also direct fluids down to bladder which influence urination
		- If this Lung function is normal, urination will be normal
		- if it is impaired, triggers urinary retention, especially in old people.
	- Since lungs play vital role in metabolism of fluids in upper burner, it is called "Upper source of water"
	- Fluids enter the Stomach, the refined part is transmitted upward to the Spleen. Spleen-Qi, in turn, spreads it upwards to the Lungs who, regulating 
	the Water passages, send it down to the Bladder.
	 - Through its diffusing and descending functions, the Lungs are therefore responsible for the excretion of Body Fluids through sweat
	 	- due to the diffusing of fluids in the space between skin and muscles - urine (due to the connection between Lungs and Bladder).
	- The Lungs’ diffusing and descending of Body Fluids is part of the Upper Burner physiology in fluid metabolism. 
	- One of the major functions of the Triple Burner is that of transformation, transportation and excretion of fluids.
	- The Triple Burner is a system of body ‘cavities’, some large and some small. 
		- The large cavities are the chest cavity (Upper Burner), abdominal cavity (Middle Burner) and  pelvic  cavity  (Lower Burner).
	- The Triple Burner is in charge of the movement, transformation and excretion of  body fluids between these cavities
		- For this, it relies on a proper ascending–descending and entering–exiting of Qi in all cavities and all organs.
